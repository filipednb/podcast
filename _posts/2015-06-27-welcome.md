  <p>Demo for the JW Player support forums, as you <a href="http://www.longtailvideo.com/support/forums/jw-player/working-with-wordpress/36869/how-to-override-settings-output#comment-204952">requested</a>.</p>
  <div id="player">Loading...</div>
  <!-- The documentation told me to place the JS 'at the location you want the video to appear', but it would be more appropriate to add this to the JS section -->
  <script>
    jwplayer("player").setup({
       "width":"100%",
       "height":26,
       "primary":"html5",
    "file":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/94677785/codepen-asset_beep.mp3" // tick sound from http://css-tricks.com/?p=17841

  <p>How I think the WordPress plugin should be adjusted to support responsive video <em>and audio</em> players. Check the description below the image for details.</p>

    <figcaption>Delete the 'Player Size' option because it's a restriction when you're using an audio-only player. Add radio buttons to '<del>Fixed</del> width' with an option to set a fixed <code>width</code> and an option to use the value <code>"width": "100%"</code>, which makes it responsive. And add radio buttons to '<del>Fixed</del> height' with an option to set the <code>aspectratio</code>, which overrides <code>height</code> (according to the docs) and an option to use a fixed <code>height</code>. The settings above would make the audio player responsive.</figcaption>
